# JabRef extension "Abstract Translator"

This is the project repository for the JabRef extension "Abstract Translator". The project was created as part of the GymInf "Software Engineering" course at the University of Basel, held by Dr. Marcel LÃ¼thi during Fall Semester 2022.

The goal of the project was to provide users with the possibility to automatically translate into German abstracts contained in a JabRef library.

Specific details of the project and implementation may be found in the Functional Specification and Technical Documentation.
